## Agile Test Automation Metrics

##### These metrics provide insight into the efficiency, reliability, and maintainability of the test automation process and can help agile teams make informed decisions about their test automation efforts.

##### Measuring these metrics can help agile teams understand the strengths and weaknesses of their test automation process and make continuous improvements.


- **Test automation coverage:** the percentage of tests automated compared to the total number of tests.

- **Automated test pass rate:** the percentage of automated tests that pass when run.

- **Automated test execution time:** the amount of time it takes for automated tests to run and complete.

- **Defect discovery rate:** the number of defects found by automated tests compared to manual testing.

- **Mean time to repair (MTTR):** the average time it takes to fix a defect found by an automated test.

- **Test maintenance costs:** the costs associated with maintaining and updating the automated tests.

- **Test case reuse:** the number of times an automated test case has been used across multiple sprints or releases.

- **Test case development time:** the amount of time it takes to develop an automated test case, including writing, debugging, and maintenance.

- **Test case execution speed:** the time it takes for an automated test case to execute and provide a result.

- **Test environment stability:** the frequency and duration of downtime in the test environment, which can impact the reliability of test automation results.

- **Test case design quality:** the design quality of automated test cases, including the use of best practices, readability, and maintainability.

- **Test script reliability:** the reliability of the automated test scripts, including the number of failures or errors and the time it takes to resolve them.

- **Test data management:** the effectiveness of the test data management strategy, including data creation, storage, and management.
