The pillars of continuous integration (CI) are:

Automated Builds: CI involves setting up a process for automated building and testing of code changes.

Version Control: Using version control systems like Git to track changes to the codebase and make it easier to merge changes and keep track of bugs.

Test Automation: Running automated tests as part of the build process to catch bugs and regressions early.

Feedback: Providing developers with feedback on their code changes as soon as possible, allowing them to fix problems early in the development process.

Collaboration: Encouraging collaboration between developers by providing a centralized repository for code changes, allowing developers to work together on the same codebase.

Continuous Deployment: The ultimate goal of CI is to enable continuous deployment, where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production with minimal manual intervention.
