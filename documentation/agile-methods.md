There are several types of Agile methodologies, each with its own unique set of practices, processes, and values. Here are some of the most commonly used Agile methodologies:

Scrum - A time-boxed, iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement.

Kanban - A visual, pull-based method for managing work that focuses on visualizing the workflow, limiting work in progress, and making process policies explicit.

Extreme Programming (XP) - An Agile methodology that emphasizes technical practices, such as continuous integration and test-driven development, to improve software quality and speed.

Lean Software Development - A methodology based on the principles of Lean manufacturing, with a focus on maximizing value, minimizing waste, and continuous improvement.

Feature-Driven Development (FDD) - A methodology that focuses on delivering small, incremental improvements to software in a series of short development cycles.

Crystal - A family of Agile methodologies that are tailored to different project sizes and environments, with a focus on adapting the methodology to fit the unique needs of each project.

Adaptive Software Development (ASD) - An Agile methodology that emphasizes flexibility and adaptation, allowing the team to adjust their processes and practices as the project evolves.

These are just a few examples of the many different Agile methodologies that exist. The choice of methodology depends on the specific needs and constraints of each project, and teams may choose to adopt elements from multiple methodologies or create their own custom approach.


Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) - A rapid application development methodology that emphasizes delivering working software quickly and embracing change.

Agile Unified Process (AUP) - A hybrid methodology that combines elements of the Rational Unified Process with Agile principles.

Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) - A hybrid methodology that combines elements of Agile, Lean, and project management best practices to deliver software efficiently and effectively.

Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) - A framework for scaling Agile development across multiple teams and projects, with a focus on enabling large organizations to deliver software faster and with better quality.

Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) - A framework for scaling Scrum to support the development of large software products by multiple teams.

Nexus - A framework for scaling Scrum across multiple teams and projects, with a focus on synchronizing the development of interdependent products.

Kanban Method - A methodology for improving the flow of work in service delivery, manufacturing, and other industries, by visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and making process policies explicit.

Context-Driven Agile - An approach to Agile development that emphasizes the importance of context and adapting the methodology to fit the specific needs and constraints of each project.

Lean Startup - A methodology for developing new products and businesses, with a focus on validated learning, minimum viable product, and rapid experimentation.

Agile Modeling (AM) - A practice-based methodology for modeling and designing software, with a focus on collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement.

Agile Data Warehouse Design (ADWD) - A methodology for designing data warehouses that emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and rapid delivery.

Agile Testing - An approach to software testing that emphasizes collaboration, continuous testing, and rapid feedback.

OpenAgile - An Agile methodology that emphasizes openness, adaptability, and collaboration, and provides a flexible framework for Agile development.

These are just a few more examples of the many Agile methodologies that exist. The important thing is to choose a methodology that fits the specific needs and constraints of your team, organization, and project, and to be willing to evolve and adapt your approach over time.



Agile Product Development (APD) - A methodology for developing new products, with a focus on customer discovery, continuous improvement, and rapid experimentation.

Agile Process and System Development (APSD) - A methodology for developing complex systems and processes, with a focus on collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement.

Agile Project Management (APM) - A methodology for managing projects using Agile principles and practices, with a focus on delivering value, embracing change, and continuous improvement.

Agile Business Analysis (ABA) - A methodology for analyzing business requirements and delivering solutions, with a focus on collaboration, continuous improvement, and rapid feedback.

Agile Service Management (ASM) - A methodology for managing services, with a focus on collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement.


In summary, Agile is a set of principles, while Scrum is a specific implementation of those principles in the form of a framework.
