A defect fix template can be used to guide the resolution of defects and ensure that they are fixed in a consistent and efficient manner. A typical defect fix template may include the following elements:

Defect description: A clear and concise description of the defect, including its background, symptoms, and impact.

Root cause analysis: An analysis of the root cause of the defect, based on the available data and information. This may include a cause-and-effect diagram, such as a fishbone diagram or Ishikawa diagram, to help visualize the relationship between the cause(s) and the defect.

Proposed solution: A proposed solution to address the root cause of the defect, including a description of the changes that will be made and their expected impact.

Test plan: A plan for testing the proposed solution, including any necessary tests, test data, and test cases, to verify that the solution is effective and does not cause any new defects or side effects.

Implementation: The implementation of the proposed solution, including any necessary code changes, documentation updates, or configuration adjustments.

Test results: The results of testing the proposed solution, including any necessary adjustments or improvements based on the test results.

Verification: Verification that the solution effectively addresses the root cause of the defect and that the resolution does not cause any new defects or side effects.

Documentation: Any necessary documentation updates, including any changes to the code, design, or test documentation.

The specific elements of a defect fix template may vary depending on the context and the method used, but these elements provide a good starting point for fixing defects in a consistent and efficient manner.


A defect process template can be used to guide the management of defects and ensure that they are tracked, documented, and resolved in a consistent and efficient manner. A typical defect process template may include the following elements:

Defect tracking: A system for tracking and documenting defects, including a unique identifier, description, priority, and status.

Defect categorization: A method for categorizing defects based on their severity, priority, and impact, to ensure that the most critical defects are addressed first.

Defect assignment: A process for assigning defects to the appropriate person or team for resolution, based on their expertise, availability, and workload.

Defect investigation: A method for investigating and reproducing defects, including any necessary testing or debugging, to determine their root cause and resolution.

Defect resolution: A process for resolving defects, including any necessary code changes, documentation updates, or configuration adjustments.

Defect verification: A method for verifying that defects are resolved and that the resolution does not cause any new defects or side effects.

Defect closure: A process for closing defects once they are resolved and verified, including any necessary documentation updates and status changes.

Defect review: A periodic review of the defect process and the defects that have been resolved, to identify any trends, patterns, or opportunities for improvement.
