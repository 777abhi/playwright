Test coverage: Measure the percentage of features and functionality that are covered by automated tests. This metric can give you a sense of how comprehensive your automation coverage is.

Pass rate: Track the percentage of automated tests that pass. A high pass rate indicates that the tests are effectively catching issues and verifying that the application is functioning as intended.

Maintenance time: Measure the time and effort required to maintain the automated tests over time, including fixing broken tests and updating tests as the application evolves.

Test execution time: Track the time it takes for the automated tests to run, and compare it to the time it would take to perform the same tests manually. A reduction in test execution time can indicate the efficiency gains of automation.

Defect detection rate: Track the number of defects that are detected by the automated tests, and compare it to the number of defects that are detected manually. A higher defect detection rate for automated tests can indicate that they are more effective at catching issues.

Time to market: Track the time it takes to go from code completion to release, and compare it to previous releases. A reduction in time to market can indicate the benefits of automation, such as faster and more efficient testing.
