There are several types of root cause analysis (RCA) that can be used to identify the underlying cause(s) of a problem. Some common types of RCA include:

Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa Diagram): A visual tool used to identify and categorize the possible causes of a problem, using a skeletal diagram with branches for each possible cause.

5 Whys Analysis: A simple and straightforward approach that involves asking the question "Why?" repeatedly to identify the root cause of a problem.

Root Cause Tree Analysis: A visual representation of the relationships between the various causes of a problem, with the root cause(s) at the top of the tree and the contributing factors below.

Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA): A systematic method for identifying and evaluating the potential failures of a product, process, or system, and the consequences of those failures.

Fault Tree Analysis (FTA): A visual representation of the relationships between the events that can lead to a failure, with the top event being the failure and the contributing events being the root causes.

Pareto Analysis: A method for prioritizing problems based on their impact and frequency, using a chart or graph that shows the relative contribution of each problem to the total.

Statistical Process Control (SPC): A method for analyzing data to identify patterns and trends in a process, and to determine the root cause of any deviations from the desired process performance.

These are some of the most common types of root cause analysis. The type of RCA used may depend on the nature of the problem, the data available, and the method preferred by the team conducting the RCA.

An RCA (Root Cause Analysis) template can be used to guide the RCA process and document the findings. A typical RCA template may include the following elements:

Problem description: A description of the problem or issue being investigated, including its background, symptoms, and impact.

Data collection: A summary of the data collected during the RCA process, including any relevant information, logs, metrics, and symptoms.

Root cause analysis: An analysis of the root cause(s) of the problem, based on the data collected and other information. This may include a cause-and-effect diagram, such as a fishbone diagram or Ishikawa diagram, to help visualize the relationship between the cause(s) and the problem.

Recommended solutions: A list of recommended solutions to address the root cause(s), including a description of each solution, its feasibility, impact, and risk.

Verification of solutions: Evidence or verification that the solutions effectively address the root cause(s) and prevent the problem from recurring in the future.

Lessons learned: A summary of the lessons learned from the RCA process, including any best practices, insights, or recommendations for future RCA processes.

Action plan: A plan for implementing the recommended solutions, including any necessary actions, responsibilities, and deadlines.

Conclusion: A conclusion of the RCA process, including a summary of the findings, lessons learned, and recommended next steps.

The specific elements of an RCA template may vary depending on the context and the method used, but these elements provide a good starting point for documenting the RCA process and its findings.
